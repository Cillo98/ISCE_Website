# ISCE Website
This website if for the ISCE club in Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.

This is the first version of the website: it contains three pages for the introduction of the club, the list of the ongoing projects and a project page. The page with the list of ongoing projects is arranged following a tile layout: projects are displayed in cards generated with JavaScript reading from a file saved on the server. The project page is one only and contains no content, only the structure of the page; the content is inserted again with a JS that takes the data from a text file.

In the future the website will be updated to use a database instead of a text file to store information and the layout will be slightly improved.
